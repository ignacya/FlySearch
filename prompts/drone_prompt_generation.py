        To help you with the coordinate system, each image has a gridline overlay with annotated dots. These roughly represent where would you move if you were to move this amount of meters in the given direction. Note that there are negative coordinates as well -- they are meant to illustrate the movement in the opposite direction. You should move by positive values only and specify the direction.
